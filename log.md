| 2023.07.03 | 4.38 h | **1**  Learned Lists and Tuples in Python.  **2**  a bit of debugging. | **1** list - 1st item =[0], but last item = [-1] ;; **2** a bit strange way to access tuples[(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)] ;; **3** That I can handle debugging in a "comfortable way", in a relax state, just read what it writes to you and fix that. And its even interesting process! ;; **4** If I dont understand topic completely - you can return to that later, after my mind was in "diffused mode". Its more effective way to handle with that ;; **5** was surpriced which result this slice return: print(f{array[1:3:-1]}). But its pretty logical| Lists - index[:3],[3:],[:-1]/ .append() / .pop() / del nums[1], del nums[1:3], del nums [:] -delete all // slice [::-1] /// tuple print(f"1:{items[0]}{items[1]} // **2**  test and debbug my code at pythontutor.com/ to understand the logic code perform| +2 hours in gym, where my mind went into "diffuced mode" and helped to figure out for "slice" of array[1:5:2] works **2** heard cool thing that programming is like videogames with community and escapism, but you can just code +1 hour without guilty pleasure feeling [3 steps from gaming to coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jclr0N6mvUI&list=LL&index=3&ab_channel=bigboxSWE)]|
| 2023.07.02 | 4.35 h | Types of errors in debugging | that its much more easier to debbug program, that i thought. It can even be exciting. It for a bit challenging for me but I handled it | debbugning | Cool state of mind before sleep. No thoughts, just empty brain. |

[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Next steps:
1) Boot.dev - Functions
2) EdX: CS1301xI - Ch1.3 - Debugging. 
3) If smth hard and you stuck, you can solidify your skills with codewards. And return again to place that you stuck at after. (fast feedback loop). 


Process: 
1) start programming as 1st priority task ( earlier you get up - easier to accomplish goals )
2) start stopwatch
3) stop stopwatch - write in a app.
4) at the next day, copy data from add to GitHub.


Overall:
1) Remember programming is a maraphon, not a sprint. Dont try to make the most of every second, minute, hour. Dont try to work extra hour at night if it makes you feel worse tomorrow (for example at luck of sleep).
2) Take it easy and fun. Try to get result as fast as possible, even from loop, if-statement of function. Start with small chunks that works and makes you happy. 
3) Feel comfortable about feeling uncomfortable.
