And its even interesting process! ;; **4** If I dont understand topic completely - you can return to that later, after my mind was in "diffused mode".

[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Next steps:
1) Boot.dev - Functions
2) EdX: CS1301xI - Ch1.3 - Debugging. 
3) If stuck somewhere, you can solidify your skills with [codewards](https://www.codewars.com/post/8-reasons-why-codewarriors-practice-coding-with-codewars). Stopped at [If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b077ebdaf15be5c7f000077/train/python)



Process: 
1) start programming as 1st priority task ( earlier you get up - easier to accomplish goals )
2) start stopwatch
3) stop stopwatch - write in a app.
4) at the next day, copy data from add to GitHub.


Overall:
1) Remember programming is a maraphon, not a sprint. Dont try to make the most of every second, minute, hour. Dont try to work extra hour at night if it makes you feel worse tomorrow (for example at luck of sleep). If you exaust yourself every time, brain will percieve programming as negative trait, not positive.
2) Take it easy and fun. Try to get result as fast as possible, even from loop, if-statement of function. Start with small chunks that works and makes you happy. 
3) Feel comfortable about feeling uncomfortable.
