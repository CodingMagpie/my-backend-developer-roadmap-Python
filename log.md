| 2023.07.03 |  h | Learned Lists and Tuples in Python.  | **1** list - 1st item =[0], but last item = [-1] ;; **2** a bit strange way to access tuples[(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)] ;; **3** That I can handle debugging in a "comfortable way", in a relax state, just read what it writes to you and fix that. And its even interesting process! ;; **4** If I dont understand topic completely - you can return to that later, after my mind was in "diffused mode". Its more effective way to handle with that | Lists - index[:3],[3:],[:-1]/ .append() / .pop() / del () // slice [::-1] /// tuple print(f"1:{items[0]}{items[1]}| - |
| 2023.07.02 | 4.35 h | Types of errors in debugging | that its much more easier to debbug program, that i thought. It can even be exciting. | debbugning | Good job today :D |
