| 2023.07.x  | - | - | **1** I strugled for 1 task for around an hour. But I should better to google how to solve part of the task instead of hitting a wall with my head.  | - | - |
| 2023.07.05  | 2 h | Dictionaries. I haven`t solved any excersises yet. Stuck at 1st task with function.   | **1** Solving little excersises dont make you a better programmer. To become a better programmer you should start little miniprojects **2** problem solving in coding spreads into other areas of the life. I noticed that when did my test task. I changed my attitude to problems. **3** functions work not they way I expected. They returned "None" instead of loop.  | Fuctions  | I did my test task for job ~6h. + went to gym. Have not enough time.  |
| 2023.07.04  | 5.66 h | **1** lots of string functions: "return x.replace(' ' ,'')". Down the rabbit hole - [Python String](https://waymoot.org/home/python_string/) **2** if you need to do some "usual" operation with data type, it`s 80% chance, that language already has method for that| That I can be persistant and have fun with debugging. **2** function can have few parameters and return few returns, if function return nothing - its None | **1** I will check [this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20210413175924/https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/Appendices/errorsAndDebug.html) about debugging much more times :D **2** if I stuck, especially with logical bug, its better to make pause, walk a bit and write pseudocode logic on a paper | its all about invested time&energy,I was solving task for 40 minutes. More effort I put - closer to solution I get   |
| 2023.07.03 | 4.38 h | **1**  Learned Lists and Tuples in Python.  **2**  a bit of debugging. | **1** list - 1st item =[0], but last item = [-1] ;; **2** a bit strange way to access tuples[(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)] ;; **3** That I can handle debugging in a "comfortable way", in a relax state, just read what it writes to you and fix that. And its even interesting process! ;; **4** If I dont understand topic completely - you can return to that later, after my mind was in "diffused mode". Its more effective way to handle with that ;; **5** was surpriced which result this slice return: print(f{array[1:3:-1]}). But its pretty logical| Lists - index[:3],[3:],[:-1]/ .append() / .pop() / del nums[1], del nums[1:3], del nums [:] -delete all // slice [::-1] /// tuple print(f"1:{items[0]}{items[1]} // **2**  test and debbug my code at pythontutor.com/ to understand the logic code perform| +2 hours in gym, where my mind went into "diffuced mode" and helped to figure out for "slice" of array[1:5:2] works **2** heard cool thing that programming is like videogames with community and escapism, but you can just code +1 hour without guilty pleasure feeling [3 steps from gaming to coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jclr0N6mvUI&list=LL&index=3&ab_channel=bigboxSWE)]|
| 2023.07.02 | 4.35 h | Types of errors in debugging | that its much more easier to debbug program, that i thought. It can even be exciting. It for a bit challenging for me but I handled it | debbugning | Cool state of mind before sleep. No thoughts, just empty brain. |

[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Next steps:
1) Boot.dev - Functions
2) EdX: CS1301xI - Ch1.3 - Debugging. 
3) If stuck somewhere, you can solidify your skills with [codewards](https://www.codewars.com/post/8-reasons-why-codewarriors-practice-coding-with-codewars). Stopped at [If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b077ebdaf15be5c7f000077/train/python)



Process: 
1) start programming as 1st priority task ( earlier you get up - easier to accomplish goals )
2) start stopwatch
3) stop stopwatch - write in a app.
4) at the next day, copy data from add to GitHub.


Overall:
1) Remember programming is a maraphon, not a sprint. Dont try to make the most of every second, minute, hour. Dont try to work extra hour at night if it makes you feel worse tomorrow (for example at luck of sleep). If you exaust yourself every time, brain will percieve programming as negative trait, not positive.
2) Take it easy and fun. Try to get result as fast as possible, even from loop, if-statement of function. Start with small chunks that works and makes you happy. 
3) Feel comfortable about feeling uncomfortable.
