# my backend developer roadmap Python
Roadmap with "Soft skilles" and "Hards killes" 
my definition:
- Soft skills - skills that help you to do your job. At this case it will be learning skills. Soft skills more important -> why is more important then "what"
- Hard skills - learning technical skills and appliing them to my projects. And creating projects.



### Set goals:
#### Short-term:
- follow [these beliefs](https://blog.boot.dev/about/#our-beliefs)
  - Coding is fun, don’t make it dull
  - Computer science matters, degrees don’t
  - You need to build
  - You need to deploy
  - It’s hard to find good resources
  - Learning to code is a depth-first algorithm
  - It’s a marathon, not a sprint
  - You should be uncomfortable (90/10%new info)
  - Get an on-site, full-time job first
- first milestone to accomplish. Spend 300 hours on practice, to become a "perfomance artist". Its all about nurture, not nature.
- pick up a few quality sourses of information and focus on them
- articles with recomendations that may help at start:
  - [How to Learn to Code - 8 Hard Truths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtfbWkxJTHw)
  - [just Google is - How to deal with anxiety in programming, when you just start learning programing](https://www.google.com/search?q=How+to+deal+with+anxiety+in+programming%2C+when+you+just+start+learning+programing&rlz=1C1SQJL_ruUA864UA864&oq=How+to+deal+with+anxiety+in+programming%2C+when+you+just+start+learning+programing&aqs=chrome..69i57.153j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), You may also ask ChatGPT :D
  - [10 Signs You Will Suck at Programming](https://medium.com/@jonathanbluks/10-signs-you-will-suck-at-programming-5497a6a52c5c), [What Makes a Good Developer?](https://medium.com/@jonathanbluks/what-makes-a-good-developer-80330712e22)

  
- [x] create learning project in my database and put information from learning there. 
- [x] make own motivational letter, about "why I should I become a software engeneer" (make it through 8 levels)


#### Long-term:
- milestone to accomplish. Spend 1500 hours on practacing to become a "dungeon master".
- be exited about programming and computing. Learn new valuable things that I use in work and practice all the time. 
- become an awesome software engeneer.
- apply new AI-technologies in work.
- contribute value into community 
- never think about "making money again"



## Milestones:  (`25h atm.`)
- [ ] 50 hours - Jabroni  
- [ ] 100 hours - slave
- [ ] 300 hours - college boy
- [ ] 500 hours - perfomance artist
- [ ] 750 hours - leatherman
- [ ] 1000 hours - Billy
- [ ] 1500 hours - Dungeon Master


## Hard Skills/ Practice:
### Learning courses:
1) [CS1301xI](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:GTx+CS1301xI+1T2023/home))  part of this big program [Learn the fundamentals of computer science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/introduction-to-python-programming). Goal - learn it all till deadlines. Add information to my Database(onenote). 
2) [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/). Practice makes perfect. Goal: be at weekly "top 16" learderboard.

#### own projects: `in progress`.
#### help others: when I get a bit more experience. 

#### list of next learning materials, after I finish previous:  
- [clean code](https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-clean-code/), or any other course, book. 




## Soft skills part:
### to keep going:
- have a good sleep. 
- dont forget to eat 3 times a day. Focus on slow carbs then fast sugars(sweets).
- excersise in the gym 2-3 times a week. Go out, at least for a walk (dont be like "печерна тварина").
- make programming as your `1st priority`. Start programming from morning, even before checking your smartphone.


### How to make studing more fun:
- just practice and be happy when you enter [Flow Mode](https://hubstaff.com/blog/how-to-get-into-the-flow-mode/).
- try to accomplish MVP as soon as you can, to feel reward. It works with small chunks of code too. 
- use 90/10 rule. Try to keep new material in amount not more then 10% of overall material.
- when you feel that its hard to keep focus on subject - take a break. Dont force yourself when you`re uneffective. Take breaks at least every 1-2 hours. 


### my own struggles that waste lots of my mental energy and time:
- Military office is my pain and source of stress. Government changed law about military. I have deferment by law, but:
  - I dont know which documents I should gather for deferment right now. Only thing I can do right now is wait for a new procedure and _ask people who go to military office do they have new information_.
  - Gather needed documents and go into military office again. And come there 5 times (2 month) to get 6 month deferment. 
  - I already finished military medical commission, and can be called to army any moment (which count only if I get paper and sign on that). Fishined medical commission at April`23 and they didnt call me yet.
  - maybe change place of living in a long-term.
  - Further steps:
    - [ ] Go to ЦНАП with passport and military ID to fix issue in registration.
    - [ ] write to #35 03.07.23 and #50 13.07.23 about do they have any info for me.
