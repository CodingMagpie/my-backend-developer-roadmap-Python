# my backend developer roadmap Python
Roadmap with "Soft skilles" and "Hards killes" 
my definition:
- Soft skills - skills that help you to do your job. At this case it will be learning skills. Soft skills more important -> why is more important then "what". + Communication skills, for more productive work with team members and clients. 
- Hard skills - learning technical skills and appliing them to my projects. And creating projects.

## Its all about anwering 3 main querstions
### Why? - the most important question
Why do you want to learn programming/computing? Its not easest dispcipline to learn. So why do you learn that? What do you want accomplish? How that aling with you lifestyle?
How programming aling with your identity and values? 

### What? - the easiest question
There are lots of materials and roadmaps out there. Everyone can google what to do. The main issue is that people dont dedicate to that. They still trying to find "magic pill" and "cut edges" not to learn all that stuff. 
In case if you dont know where to start. Here is lot of [roadmaps:"How to become a..."](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) 

### How? - how to make it interesting for you
Find your way to learn all that. Pick books/courses/projects in a way its fun and exciting for you.

## Set goals:
#### Short-term:
- follow [these beliefs](https://blog.boot.dev/about/#our-beliefs)
  - Coding is fun, don’t make it dull
  - Computer science matters, degrees don’t
  - You need to build
  - You need to deploy
  - It’s hard to find good resources
  - Learning to code is a depth-first algorithm
  - It’s a marathon, not a sprint
  - You should be uncomfortable (90/10%new info)
  - Get an on-site, full-time job first
- first milestone to accomplish. Spend 300 hours on practice, to become a "perfomance artist". Its all about nurture, not nature.
- pick up a few quality sourses of information and focus on them
- articles with recomendations that may help at start:

- [x] create learning project in my database and put information from learning there. 
- [x] make own motivational letter, about "why I should I become a software engeneer" (make it through 8 levels)


#### Long-term:
- milestone to accomplish. Spend 1500 hours on practacing to become a "dungeon master".
- be exited about programming and computing. Learn new valuable things that I use in work and practice all the time. 
- become an awesome software engeneer.
- apply new AI-technologies in work.
- contribute value into community 
- never think about "making money again"



## Milestones: 
- [ ] 50 hours - Jabroni  
- [ ] 100 hours - slave
- [ ] 300 hours - college boy
- [ ] 500 hours - perfomance artist
- [ ] 750 hours - leatherman
- [ ] 1000 hours - Billy
- [ ] 1500 hours - Dungeon Master


## Hard Skills/ Practice:
### Learning courses:
1) [CS1301xI](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:GTx+CS1301xI+1T2023/home))  part of this big program [Learn the fundamentals of computer science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/introduction-to-python-programming). Goal - learn it all till deadlines. Add information to my Database(onenote). 
2) [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/). **Practice makes Permanent**. Goal: be at weekly top 3 - top10 learderboard.
3) after I finish previous: [clean code](https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-clean-code/)
4) next - [git materials](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/2022_UA/tasks/git-intro.md)

#### own projects: `in progress`.
#### help others: when I get a bit more experience. 





## Soft skills part:
### to keep going:
- have a good sleep. 
- dont forget to eat 3 times a day. Focus on slow carbs then fast sugars(sweets).
- excersise in the gym 2-3 times a week. Go out, at least for a walk (dont be like "печерна тварина").
- make programming as your `1st priority`. Start programming from morning, even before checking your smartphone.
- take away all "easy" distractions, youtube, news, memes and so on. Your main sourse of fun is programming. Check your motivation paper if you think other away :)
- avoid burnout [Learn to Code Without Burning Out: How I Did It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bAZXEjxDDE&list=LL&index=5&ab_channel=JamesCross)


### How to make studing more fun:
- just practice and be happy when you enter [Flow Mode](https://hubstaff.com/blog/how-to-get-into-the-flow-mode/).
- try to accomplish MVP as soon as you can, to feel reward. It works with small chunks of code too. 
- use 90/10 rule. Try to keep new material in amount not more then 10% of overall material.
- when you feel that its hard to keep focus on subject - take a break. Dont force yourself when you`re uneffective. Take breaks at least every 1-2 hours.
- [Software Engineering Anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Afvtij-o2w). The most atomic start possible.

### my own struggles that waste lots of my mental energy and time:
- Military office is my pain and source of stress. Government changed law about military. I have deferment by law, but:
  - I dont know which documents I should gather for deferment right now. Only thing I can do right now is wait for a new procedure and _ask people who go to military office do they have new information_.
  - Gather needed documents and go into military office again. And come there 5 times (2 month) to get 6 month deferment. 
  - I already finished military medical commission, and can be called to army any moment (which count only if I get paper and sign on that). Fishined medical commission at April`23 and they didnt call me yet.
  - maybe change place of living in a long-term.
  - Further steps:
    - [ ] Go to ЦНАП with passport and military ID to fix issue in registration.
    - [ ] check message to #50 at 13.07.23 and check message to #35 at 20.07.23 -> if they have any info for me.
