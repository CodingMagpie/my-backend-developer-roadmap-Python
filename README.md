# my backend developer roadmap Python
Roadmap with "Soft skilles" and "Hards killes" 
my definition of Soft skills - skills that help you to do your job. At this case it will be learning skills. Soft skills more important 
my definition of Hard skills - learning technical skills and appliing them to my projects. And creating projects.



### Set goals:
#### Short-term:
- follow [these beliefs](https://blog.boot.dev/about/#our-beliefs)
  - Coding is fun, don’t make it dull
  - Computer science matters, degrees don’t
  - You need to build
  - You need to deploy
  - It’s hard to find good resources
  - Learning to code is a depth-first algorithm
  - It’s a marathon, not a sprint
  - You should be uncomfortable
  - Get an on-site, full-time job first
- first milestone to accomplish. Spend 300 hours on practice, to become a "perfomance artist". Its all about nurture, not nature.     
- articles with recomendations that may help at start:
  - pick up a few sourses of information and just focus on them
  -

  
- [x] create learning project in my database and put information from learning there. 
- [x] make own motivational letter, about "why I should I become a software engeneer" (make it through 8 levels)
- [x] 

#### Long-term:
- milestone to accomplish. Spend 1500 hours on practacing to become a "dungeon master".
- be exited about programming and computing. Learn new valuable things that I use in work and practice all the time. 
- become an awesome software engeneer.
- apply new AI-technologies in work.
- contribute value into community 
- never think about "making money again"
